# PullToRefreshControl

"PullToRefreshControl" is a custom subclass of UIRefreshControl, designed to enhance the functionality of the standard pull-to-refresh action in iOS applications. This control is specifically tailored for use with UITableView, offering a programmable approach to initiate the refresh action and addressing a common issue where the refresh animation pauses or fails to resume correctly.

Key Features

1. Programmatic Refresh Triggering:
The control introduces a method, pullToRefresh(), allowing developers to initiate the pull-to-refresh action programmatically. This is particularly useful for scenarios where the refresh needs to be triggered without user interaction, such as during the initial loading of the table view.
2. Handling App State Transitions:
It automatically manages the refresh control's state during various app state transitions. This includes scenarios where the app returns from the background, or when the user navigates back to the view controller containing the UITableView.
3. Seamless Animation Continuity:
The cancelOrRestartRefreshingIfNeeded() method ensures that the refresh animation continues seamlessly. It addresses the common issue where the animation gets paused or stuck, especially after the app transitions from the background or when returning from another view controller.
4. Improved User Experience:
By fixing the interrupted animation issue, this control provides a smoother and more consistent user experience. It maintains the visual feedback that users expect when they initiate a refresh action.
